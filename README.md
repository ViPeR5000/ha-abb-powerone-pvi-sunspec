# Enabling Modbus TCP on SolarEdge Inverter
Enable wifi direct on the inverter. Connect to the inverter access point like you would for a normal wifi network. The wifi password is published at the right side of the inverter. Then open up a browser and go to http://172.16.0.1 . From this webpage you can enable modbus TCP without setApp or installer account.
